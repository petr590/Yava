Added decompilation stats, which are output after decompilation of all classes, to make it easier to debug the code.

The example testing system has been redesigned.

Assembly has been added (so far only assembly code parsing, the function is under development).

Fixed a bug with shift operators for long.

Fixed a bug with UncertainReferenceType and arrays of primitives.

The project has been renamed to Yava.
